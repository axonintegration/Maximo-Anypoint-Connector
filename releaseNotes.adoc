//The following is a proposed connector documentation template for documenting Release notes for MuleSoft connectors.

//
//== References:
//
//- <System_Name>: The system the connector connects to, at the other end of the mule runtime, i.e. SalesForce, Workday Financials, 
//
//- <Release_date>: The date in which the connector is released (not when the notes are written, mind you)
//
//- <Connector_Version>: Describes the connector version, such as “V2013”, “V4.0”, “V4.0.1-HF2” or whatever used for release
//
//- <Connector_Guide_Url>: Points to the mulesoft.org pages for documentation on the functional aspects of the connector. e.g.: http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Microsoft+SharePoint+2013+Connector

Release Notes for version 1.0.0 of the Maximo connector. These Release Notes accompany the  <Connector_Guide_URL> guide.
 
=== Compatibility
The Maximo connector is compatible with:

|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Maximo|7 and above

|Mule Runtime|3.6.x
|Maximo Connector|1.0.0
|===

=== Migrating from older versions of the connector:
Not applicable as this is the first public release 

//If you’re currently using connector <old_connector_version> to migrate to this connector you need to:

//- <step_1>
//- <step_2>

//If you’re currently using a connector version <old_connector_version_2> this connector is not compatible. Don’t upgrade to this connector unless you are sure you do the following:

//- <step_3>
//- <step_4>

//<Step_1 to N should be clear instructions that pertain to the migration path from one connector to the other.

//Examples might include

//- Specifying which version of the runtime is needed for the new connector
//- Changes in the version of the connected systems to be able to work
//- When the connector suffers structural changes (i.e monolythic connectors now many update sites) we should also inform the split and why and how to update from one to //the other.
//- Specific instructions if the connector is running in CloudHub (like changing the Mule Runtime version, etc)
//- The first list of steps is for in-place upgrades, probably just updating via Maven or  Anypoint Studio  and re deploying.
//- The second list is for the connectors that are older and require additional steps.
//- Some of this might not apply (i.e. a connector is backwards compatible with all released versions or there is no previous version)


=== Features

. Object Structure based web service - Execute a deployed web service that is based on a Maximo object structure

. Query and Update operations - Execute a Maximo query, add, delete, change or addChange on a Maximo entry (or batch of).

. Authentication and Security - Supports native authentication through a Maximo username and password authenticated account.  Supports HTTPS through the setting of certificates in the Mule truststore and setting of an HTTPS Maximo web app URL.

//Example of a Feature listing:

//NTLM Authentication - NTLM authentication is now more robust and widely compatible with more domain controller configurations. 

=== Fixed in this Release
Not applicable as this is the first public release 
//- <Bug_Title> - <Conditions under which the bug used to happen, explain which was the result, which is now the fixed result> 

//Example of a Bug listing:

//- Asyncronous processing now works when invoking via an External interface - Previously, when invoking an asyncronous service, the call could end up in a deadlock unless //lock(object) was used. Now, the connector locks automatically and you don’t need to do it.

//Example of what is NOT A BUG listing

//- Fixed CLDCONNECT-XYZ (because projects are not public)
//- Functional tests XYZ now work (because functional testing or any other part of the development process is not visible to customers)
//- Increased Sonar coverage (ditto)
//- Resolved NPE (lacking information like scenarios under which it can be reproduced, what is NPE, etc)

=== Known Issues
- No support for customized web services of web services exposing Enterprise Services - Contact Computime Software if support is required (www.computimesoftware.com)
- No support of WebSphere MQ integration - Contact Computime Software if support is required (www.computimesoftware.com)

//<Connector_Issues, use the same format as Bug listings>
